<h3> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h3>

I have just completed my Certificate in Computing at NCI and am excited to keep learning!

</br>
<details>
  <summary>Languages I learned as part of the cert</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Languages I learned online so far</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript (Basic)</li>
  </ul>
</details>
</br>
My skills are still very basic of course - the more I learn, the more I want to know ðŸ˜„ </br></br>
I am looking to transition into the field of Software Development, or find a position where I can apply my coding skills.
Currently I have work experience in end user tech support roles, as well as content review.

Thank you for reading!
